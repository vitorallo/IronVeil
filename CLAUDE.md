## Project Overview

IronVeil is a **MicroSaaS Identity Security Platform** that provides hybrid architecture combining a minimal desktop scanner with a full-featured cloud backend. The platform identifies and assesses identity security misconfigurations and threats within both on-premises Active Directory (AD) and Microsoft Entra ID environments, delivering insights through a real-time web dashboard at **ironveil.crimson7.io**.

## Hybrid MicroSaaS Architecture

### System Components

**1. Minimal Desktop Scanner (Windows)**
- **Framework**: .NET 8 WPF with minimal UI
- **PowerShell Engine**: System.Management.Automation for rule execution
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE for cloud backend access
- **API Client**: Secure upload of scan results to cloud platform
- **Core Function**: Execute PowerShell security rules and upload results

**2. Cloud Backend Platform (ironveil.crimson7.io)**
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Backend API**: NestJS with TypeScript, RESTful endpoints
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React 18 + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Real-time**: WebSocket subscriptions for live dashboard updates
- **Integration**: EASM provider connectors and third-party APIs

**3. Business Model**

- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)

### Hybrid Data Flow
1. **Desktop Scanner**: User launches minimal WPF application
2. **Backend Selection**: Choose community (ironveil.crimson7.io) or enterprise backend
3. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow to authenticate with cloud platform
4. **Local Scanning**: PowerShell rules execute against AD/Entra ID from `/indicators` folder
5. **Secure Upload**: JSON results uploaded to cloud backend via authenticated API
6. **Real-time Processing**: Backend processes scan data and updates dashboard
7. **Live Dashboard**: Users view comprehensive results through web interface
8. **EASM Integration**: Third-party platforms consume data via RESTful APIs

## Development Structure

### Key Directories
- `/indicators/` - Security check rules and implementation patterns
  - `/pk-reference/` - Reference materials for security checks to be used only by the rule-expert-writer as a learning, do not reuse code from here.
  - `implementation-patterns.md` - Common patterns for security assessments
  - `security-check-pseudocode.md` - Templates for implementing checks
- `PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `Identity Security Indicators (checks).md` - Detailed list of security indicators

### Specialized Agents
The project uses six specialized agents with defined responsibilities:

1. **powershell-security-rules-developer**: Develops PowerShell security check rules in `/indicators` folder with standardized JSON output format for API consumption.

2. **desktop-gui-developer**: Creates minimal WPF scanner with PowerShell engine integration, secure API communication, and OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication.

3. **supabase-integration-specialist**: Designs database schema, RLS policies, real-time subscriptions, and Supabase authentication. **MUST use Context7 MCP** for latest Supabase documentation.

4. **webapp-coder-expert**: Develops Next.js frontend with real-time dashboard, multi-tenant architecture, and responsive design. **MUST use Context7 MCP** for latest Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS documentation.

5. **api-integration-developer**: Builds NestJS backend with RESTful APIs, EASM provider connectors, webhook systems, and OpenAPI documentation.

6. **testing-automation-specialist**: Creates comprehensive testing framework with E2E, API, and integration tests. **MUST use Playwright MCP** for debugging all test failures.

## Security Implementation Patterns

### Rule-Based Engine
- Security checks follow modular architecture with standardized structure
- Each check has metadata (ID, name, description, severity), parameter validation, LDAP queries, result processing
- Rules are implemented as PowerShell scripts used by the UI
- Common patterns include time-based change detection, attribute-based assessment, inactive object detection

### Risk Scoring
- Weighted risk scoring with severity levels (Critical: 100, High: 75, Medium: 50, Low: 25)
- Contextual modifiers for privileged accounts (1.5x), recent activity (1.25x), public accessibility (1.3x)
- Attack path analysis for privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence

### Data Processing
- Multi-domain processing with error handling
- Graceful degradation for permission issues
- Progressive data collection with retry logic
- Dynamic threshold calculation based on environment size

### Phase Completion Procedures

**MANDATORY: At the completion of every phase, you MUST perform these tasks:**

1. **Update TASKS.md Phase Status**:
   - Mark completed phase with ‚úÖ COMPLETED status
   - Add completion metadata: date, duration, report location
   - Update next phase to üöÄ IN EXECUTION or ‚è≥ PENDING as appropriate
   - Update Integration Checkpoints section to reflect current progress

2. **Create Phase Completion Report**:
   - Generate comprehensive `PHASE{N}-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` report
   - Include: objectives achieved, technical implementation details, success metrics
   - Document integration points available for next phases
   - Provide reproduction commands and local development access

3. **Organize Development Documentation**:
   - Move completion report to `/development_reports/` directory
   - Update TASKS.md references to point to new report location
   - Ensure `/development_reports/` directory exists before moving files

**Example Phase Completion Updates for TASKS.md**:
```markdown
## Phase N: Phase Name ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**üñ•Ô∏è Development Environment**: Environment Type
**Completed**: Date | **Duration**: Time | **Report**: `/development_reports/PHASEN-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md`

### N.1 Subsection Name **[agent-name]** ‚úÖ
- [x] Completed task 1
- [x] Completed task 2

## Phase N+1: Next Phase Name üöÄ IN EXECUTION  
**üñ•Ô∏è Development Environment**: Environment Type
**Started**: Date | **Status**: In progress description

### N+1.1 Subsection Name **[agent-name]** üöÄ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Pending task 1
- [ ] Pending task 2
```

**Integration Checkpoints Updates**:
```markdown
### Integration Checkpoints
- **Phase N**: ‚úÖ Brief description of what was completed
- **Phase N+1**: üöÄ Brief description of what's in progress (IN PROGRESS)
- **Phase N+2**: Brief description of what's pending
```

This systematic approach ensures consistent project tracking and clear visibility into development progress across all phases.
